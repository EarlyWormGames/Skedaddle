Multi-\/effector F\+A\+B\+R\+IK system. ~\newline
F\+A\+B\+R\+I\+K\+Root is a component that connects F\+A\+B\+R\+IK chains together to form extremely complicated IK systems with multiple branches, end-\/effectors and rotation limits.

{\bfseries Getting started\+:}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Create multiple F\+A\+B\+R\+IK chains, position them as you want them to be connected. The chains don\textquotesingle{}t have to be parented to each other
\item Make sure the first bone of a child chain is in the same position as the last bone of it\textquotesingle{}s parent
\item Create a new Game\+Object, add the F\+A\+B\+R\+I\+K\+Root component
\item Add all the F\+A\+B\+R\+IK chains to \char`\"{}\+Chains\char`\"{} in the F\+A\+B\+R\+I\+K\+Root component
\item Press Play
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Accessing the chains of F\+A\+B\+R\+I\+K\+Root\+:}


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{public} FABRIKRoot fabrikRoot;

\textcolor{keywordtype}{void} LateUpdate () \{
    Debug.Log(fabrikRoot.solver.chains[index].ik.name);
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Limitations\+:}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Separate F\+A\+B\+R\+IK chains can not use the same bones, they must be fully independent
\item The last bone of a F\+A\+B\+R\+IK chain must be in the same position as it\textquotesingle{}s child chain\textquotesingle{}s first bone
\end{DoxyItemize}

 {\bfseries Component variables\+:}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries time\+Step} -\/ if zero, will update the solver in every Late\+Update(). Use this for chains that are animated. If $>$ 0, will be used as updating frequency so that the solver will reach its target in the same time on all machines
\item {\bfseries fix\+Transforms} -\/ if true, will fix all the Transforms used by the solver to their initial state in each Update. This prevents potential problems with unanimated bones and animator culling with a small cost of performance
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Solver variables\+:}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries weight} -\/ the solver weight for smoothly blending out the effect of the IK
\item {\bfseries iterations} -\/ max iterations per frame.
\item {\bfseries root\+Pin} -\/ the weight of pinning the first chains to the Transform that the component is attached to
\item {\bfseries chains} -\/ the list of F\+A\+B\+R\+IK components used by this F\+A\+B\+R\+I\+K\+Root
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Chain variables\+:}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries IK} -\/ the F\+A\+B\+R\+IK component used
\item {\bfseries pull} -\/ parent pull weight. How much does this chain pull it\textquotesingle{}s parent?
\item {\bfseries pin} -\/ resistance to being pulled by child chains. If 1, this chain can not be pulled out of place by it\textquotesingle{}s child chains
\item {\bfseries children} -\/ indexes (of the \char`\"{}\+Chains\char`\"{} array) of the direct children of this chain. Don\textquotesingle{}t add children of the children.
\end{DoxyItemize}
