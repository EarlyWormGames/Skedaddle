Trigonometric IK is the most basic IK solver that is based on the Law of Cosines and solves a 3-\/segmented bone hierarchy. (I\+K\+Solver\+Limb extends I\+K\+Solver\+Trigonometric just to add a couple of extra parameters like the bend modifiers)

{\bfseries Getting started\+:}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add the Trigonometric\+IK component to the first bone.
\item Assign bone1, bone2 and bone3 in the Trigonometric\+IK component
\item Press Play
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Getting started with scripting\+:}


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{public} TrigonometricIK trig;

\textcolor{keywordtype}{void} LateUpdate () \{
    \textcolor{comment}{// Changing the target position, rotation and weights}
    trig.solver.IKPosition = something;
    trig.solver.IKRotation = something;
    trig.solver.IKPositionWeight = something;
    trig.solver.IKRotationWeight = something;

    trig.solver.SetBendGoalPosition(Vector goalPosition); \textcolor{comment}{// Sets the bend goal to a point in world space }
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Adding Trigonometric\+IK in runtime\+:}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add the Trigonometric\+IK component via script
\item Call Trigonometric\+I\+K.\+solver.\+Set\+Chain()
\end{DoxyItemize}



{\bfseries Component variables\+:}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries time\+Step} -\/ if zero, will update the solver in every Late\+Update(). Use this for chains that are animated. If $>$ 0, will be used as updating frequency so that the solver will reach its target in the same time on all machines
\item {\bfseries fix\+Transforms} -\/ if true, will fix all the Transforms used by the solver to their initial state in each Update. This prevents potential problems with unanimated bones and animator culling with a small cost of performance
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Solver variables\+:}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries bone1} -\/ the first bone (upper arm or thigh)
\item {\bfseries bone2} -\/ the second bone (forearm or calf)
\item {\bfseries bone3} -\/ the third bone (hand or foot)
\item {\bfseries target} -\/ the target Transform. If assigned, solver I\+K\+Position and I\+K\+Rotation will be automatically set to the position of the target
\item {\bfseries position\+Weight} -\/ the weight of solving to the target position (I\+K\+Position)
\item {\bfseries rotation\+Weight} -\/ the weight of solving to the target rotation (I\+K\+Rotation)
\item {\bfseries bend\+Normal} -\/ normal of the plane defined by the positions of the bones. When the limb bends, the second bone will always be positioned somewhere on that plane
\end{DoxyItemize}
